# What Comes next?

This document keeps track of how you can move forward in the world of machine learning and to ahead of what you have learned. 

We started with **Python Programming** then moved on to **Machine Learning with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning** and in the end we went with **Neural Networks with Deep Learning (CNN and RNN)**

This document contains the references where you can increase your knowledge in those domains. 


## 1. Python Programming 

Learn Python Programming : 

### Books : 

1. **Learning Python** by **Mark Lutz** : It's one of the best books on python programming. Though the content in not linear but for an indepth knowledge of python this is one of the best books. 

2. **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** by **Al Sweigart** : This is a fun book and more linear by the previous choice. In this book you will learn to do some basic tasks using python which you generally do manually. Interactive and Fun 

### Online Courses : 

The online learning industry was build upon python. Almost all the websites started online learning with python courses so there are many of them and you can choose what you like. Here is a list of what I liked.

1. [Introduction to python programming by Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110-india)

2. [Python courses on datacamp.com](datacamp.com)

3. [Harvard's CS50 Course](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)


## 2. Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is one of the hottest fields in the world right now and there are many resources available and due the rapid pace of the field it's difficult to follow along but this list might help you in that domain 

### Books 
	
1. [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Hastie et. al. One of the most recommended books in the Machine Learning World it contains all the topics from Linear Regression to Support Vector Machines and Boosting. A good read for every one interested. 

2. **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** by **Christopher Bishop** : A tougher read than the previous book but still a classic. It's mathematical and good for understanding the inside out of the ML. Ping me if you have completed all the exercises of the first chapter. A treat is on me.
